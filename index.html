        <h3>Leonard Cohen-Hallelujah</h3>
    </div>    
    <div class="verse1">
        <p>I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
            That David played and it pleased the Lord<br>
            But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
            It goes like this<br>
            The fourth, the fifth<br>
            The minor fall, the major lift<br>
            The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah [x4]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="verse2">
        <p>Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
            You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
            Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br>
            She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
            She broke your throne, she cut your hair<br>
            And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah [x4]</p>
