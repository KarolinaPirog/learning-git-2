    <div class="verse1">
        <p>I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
            That David played and it pleased the Lord<br>
            But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
            It goes like this<br>
            The fourth, the fifth<br>
            The minor fall, the major lift<br>
            The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah [x4]</p>
